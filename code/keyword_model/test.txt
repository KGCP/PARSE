Previously this classification\nwas known up to index 3+ 3. In the first paper we give an analogue\nof Haagerups\n\ninitial classification of subfactors of index less than 3 + 3, showing that any\nsubfactor of index less than 5 must appear in one of a large list of families. These\nfamilies will be considered separately in the three subsequent papers in this series.\nAMS Classification 46L37; 18D10\nKeywords Subfactors\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nA subfactor is an inclusion N  M of von Neumann algebras with trivial center. The\ntheory of subfactors can be thought of as a nonabelian version of Galois theory, and\nhas had many applications in operator algebras, quantum algebra, and knot theory.\nFor example, given a finite depth subfactor, you can produce two fusion categories\n(by taking the even parts) and a 3-dimensional TQFT (via the Ocneanu-Turaev-Viro\nconstruction [TV92, Ocn94, BW99]). The fundamental example of a subfactor, which\nillustrates the analogy with Galois theory, is when G is a finite group with an outer\naction on a factor M and the fixed point factor M G is a subfactor of M .\nA subfactor N  M has three key invariants. From strongest to weakest, they are:\nthe standard invariant (which captures all information about basic bimodules\nover M and N ), the principal and dual principal graphs (which together describe\nthe fusion rules for these basic bimodules), and the index (which is a real number\nmeasuring the size of the basic bimodules [Jon83]). For the case of the fixed point\nsubfactor the standard invariant recovers the structure of G itself, the principal\ngraph and dual principal graph recover the size of the group and the dimensions\nof each of its irreducible representations, and the index is the size of G. Thus\nstudying possible standard invariants (called paragroups [Ocn88], -lattices [Pop95],\nor subfactor planar algebras[Jon]) of a fixed index is a generalization of studying all\ngroups of a given size. In turn, studying subfactors with a fixed standard invariant\nis a generalization of studying all outer actions of a group on a factor. In particular,\njust as any finite (or more generally, amenable group) has only one action on the\nhyperfinite II1 factor [Jon80, Ocn80], any finite depth (or more generally amenable)\nsubfactor planar algebra can be realized in a unique way as a subfactor of the\nhyperfinite II1 factor [Pop90, Pop94].\nMuch early work in the theory of subfactors concerned the classification of subfactors\nof index up to 4 [GdlHJ89, Ocn88, Izu91, KO02]. One reason for concentrating on\n1\n\n\findex below 4 was that for every real number greater than 4 there is a subfactor\nwith that index and principal graph A [Pop93]. The study of subfactors of small\nindex larger than 4 was initiated by Haagerup who gave an exhaustive\n list of possible\nprincipal graphs other than A of subfactors of index less than 3+ 3 [Haa94]. Most\nof the graphs on this list were excluded by Bisch [Bis98] and Asaeda-Yasuda [AY09],\nwhile the remaining 3 graphs and their duals were shown to come from unique\nsubfactor planar algebras/-lattices/paragroups (and thus by Popa [Pop90, Pop94]\nunique subfactors of the hyperfinite II1 factor) by Asaeda-Haagerup [AH99] and\nBigelow-Morrison-Peters-Snyder [BMPS09]. The goal of this series of papers is to\ngive the following classification of irreducible subfactors of index less than 5.\nTheorem 1.1 There are exactly ten subfactor planar algebras other than TemperleyLieb with index between 4 and 5.\n The Haagerup planar algebra [AH99], with index\npair\n\u0010\n\n\n5+ 13\n2\n\nand principal bigraph\n\u0011\n\nand its dual.\n The extended Haagerup planar algebra [BMPS09], with index\nand principal bigraph pair\n\u0010\n,\nand its dual.\n The Asaeda-Haagerup planar algebra [AH99], with index\nbigraph pair\n\u0010\n,\n\n8 2\n3+3\n\n\n5+ 17\n2\n\nRe\n\nq\n3\n\n13\n2\n\n \u0001\n5  3i 3\n\u0011\n\nand principal\n\u0011\n\nand its dual.\n The3311 Goodman-de la Harpe-Jones planar algebra [GdlHJ89], with index\n3 + 3 and principal bigraph pair\n\u0010\n\u0011\n,\nand its dual (since it is not self-dual despite having the same principal and\ndual principal graphs [Kaw95]).\n Izumis self-dual\n2221 planar algebra [Izu01] and its complex conjugate, with\n\n5+ 21\nindex\nand principal bigraph pair\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n,\n.\nAs an immediate corollary (using Popas results [Pop90, Pop94]) this theorem gives\na classification of all amenable subfactors of the hyperfinite II1 factor of index\nless than 5. However, the classification of non-amenable subfactors coming from\nTemperley-Lieb is still wide open (see [Pop91, Bis94]).\nThe choice of 5 as an upper limit is convenient, but somewhat arbitrary. In particular,\nclassifying the principal graphs of subfactors at index 5 does not require a significant\n2\n\n\famount of new work. However, at index 5 there are a large number of possible graphs.\nFurthermore, although most of these graphs can be realized via group/subgroup\nsubfactors, they may also be realized in other ways. This will be addressed in work\nin joint progress with Izumi.\nIn this paper, we begin by proving a weaker classification result inspired by Haagerups\noriginal argument. In particular, we only use the combinatorics of the principal\ngraphs of the subfactors. We describe several known obstructions to being principal\ngraphs, and a method of enumerating principal graphs satisfying certain size bounds.\nCombining these, we obtain various classification results. Much of the subtlety in\nthis paper lies in finding the right balance between looking for obstructions and\nextending the enumeration, in order to produce classification results that are both\ntrue and useful!\nIn order to describe our classification (as well as Haagerups) its helpful to define\ntwo terms. We use the term translation of a graph pair to indicate a graph pair\nobtained by increasing the supertransitivity (that is, adding a longer chain of edges\nat the left) by an even integer, and the term extension of a graph pair to indicate\na graph pair obtained by extending the graphs in any way at greater depths (i.e.\nadding vertices and edges at the right). For example, the D2n principal graph pairs\nare all translations of D4 , while the Haagerup principal graph pair is an extension\nof D6 , an extension of A4 , a translated extension of D4 , and a translated extension\nof A2 . See 2.1 for more details.\nHaagerups initial classification is given in the following theorem.\n\nTheorem 1.2 [Haa94] Any subfactor of index between 4 and 3 + 3 is nonamenable with standard invariant the Temperley-Lieb algebra, or its principal graph\npair is a translate of one of the following three graph pairs.\nn\u0010\n\u0011\n,\n,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n,\n,\n\u0010\n\u0011o\n,\nHaagerup eliminated all but one graph in the second family using an unpublished\nconnection-based approach, Bisch eliminated the third family completely using fusion\nalgebra techniques [Bis98], and AsaedaYasuda [AY09] eliminated all but two graphs\nfrom the first family using arithmetic techniques.\nNumber theory techniques of Calegari-Morrison-Snyder [CMS10] (generalizing earlier\nwork of Asaeda-Yasuda [AY09]) give an effective bound on how large a translate of\na fixed graph can be a principal graph. Thus any classification along the lines of\nHaagerups can now be reduced to a finite list by applying this result. Unfortunately,\nin our case the techniques used by Haagerup do not suffice to restrict to the translations of a finite list of graph pairs. Thus, in addition to a long list of families which\ncan be eliminated using number theoretic techniques, we also have a short list of\nbad cases.\n3\n\n\fTheorem 1.3 The principal graphs of any subfactor of index between 4 and 5 is\na translate of one of an explicit finite list of graph pairs (see Theorem 6.1), or is a\ntranslated extension of one of the following graphs.\n\u0010\n\u0011\nC=\n,\n,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n,\nF=\n,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n,\nB=\n,\n\u0010\n\u0011\nQ=\n,\n,\n\u0010\n\u0011\nQ0 =\n,\nFor these remaining cases we need new techniques. Cases C , F , and B (which\nhave initial triple points) will be eliminated in joint work with Penneys and Peters\n[MPPS10], while Q and Q0 (which have initial quadruple points) will be eliminated\nin work in progress joint with Izumi and Jones [IJMS]. The uniqueness of 2221 up to\nconjugation was proved by Han [Han10], while the uniqueness of 3331 up to duality\nwill be proved in [IJMS]. Finally, in [PT10] Penneys and Tener apply the number\ntheoretic test of [CMS10] to eliminate the remaining cases.\nClassifications of subfactors of small index may be of interest for several reasons.\nWe would like to understand whether the appearance of exotic subfactors (like\nthe Haagerup, extended Haagerup, and Asaeda-Haagerup subfactors) is a common\nphenomenon, or whether these small examples are truly exceptional. We would like\nto understand where the boundary takes place between small index and large\nindex. For example, the smallest possible index other than 4 for an infinite depth\nsubfactor whose standard invariant is not Temperley-Lieb is unknown. Similarly,\nwed like to know the smallest index for which the standard invariant fails to classify\nsubfactors of the hyperfinite factor [BNP07]. In order to answer these\n questions,\neventually we would like to extend our classification up to index 3 + 5 where a\nFuss-Catalan infinite depth subfactor [BJ97] appears which may allow for some of\nthe large index behavior found at index 6.\nWe would like to thank Richard Burstein, Vaughan Jones, Dave Penneys, and Emily\nPeters for helpful conversations and careful reading of the manuscript. We also\nthank all the attendees of the Bodega Bay Planar algebra programming camps for\ntheir interest in this problem: several attendees are writing sequels to this paper.\nScott Morrison was at Microsoft Station Q at UC Santa Barbara and at the Miller\nInstitute for Basic Research at UC Berkeley during this work, and Noah Snyder was\nsupported in part by RTG grant DMS-0354321 and in part by an NSF Postdoctoral\nFellowship at Columbia University. We would also like to acknowledge support from\nthe DARPA HR0011-11-1-0001 grant.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nEnumerating principal graphs\nNotation and background\n\nThroughout, we use the following definitions.\n4\n\n\fDefinition 2.1 A bigraph is a bipartite graph with a specified root vertex. We\nallow graphs with infinitely many vertices, but require that every vertex have finite\ndegree. The depth of a vertex is the geodesic distance from the root. A bigraph\nis called finite depth if it has finitely many vertices, in which case its depth is the\nmaximum of the depths of the vertices.\nWhen we draw bigraphs, the root vertex always appears on the left, and the depth\nof a vertex is always given by its horizontal distance from the root.\nDefinition 2.2 The supertransitivity of a bigraph  is the greatest integer n so\nthat up to vertices at depth n the graph  is just An . Equivalently, it is the number\nof edges from the root vertex before the first branch point or multiple edge.\nDefinition 2.3 A bigraph with dual data is a bigraph together with an involution,\ncalled duality, of the vertices at each even depth.\nIn diagrams, duality is represented by red arcs joining dual pairs of vertices. Self-dual\nvertices have a small red dash above them.\nDefinition 2.4 A bigraph pair is a pair of bigraphs with dual data, with depths\ndiffering by at most one and the same supertransitivity, together with a bijection,\nalso called duality, between the vertices at each odd depth of one graph with the\ncorresponding vertices at the same odd depth on the other graph.\nIn diagrams, we do not explicitly indicate the bijections between odd vertices, but\nrather use the convention that the vertical ordering of vertices at a given depth\ndetermines the bijection: the lowest vertices in each graph at each odd depth are\ndual to each other, etc.\nTwo bigraph pairs are isomorphic if there is a graph isomorphism between the\nunderlying graphs which preserves the duality structure and the base vertex. For\nexample, the following two bigraph pairs are isomorphic:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n,\nWe say a bigraph pair is equal if both graphs have the same depth. Note that if a\nbigraph pair is unequal then the two depths differ by one, and the longer bigraph\nneeds to have even depth, because of the duality bijection between the odd vertices.\nThe principal graphs of a subfactor naturally carry the structure of a bigraph pair.\nFor example, the principal graphs of the Haagerup subfactor are the following pair\nof bigraphs with dual data.\nn\u0010\n\u0011o\n,\nWe say that a bigraph pair  is a translate of 0 if there is an even integer k such\nthat up to depth k , the bigraphs in  look like the Dynkin diagram Ak , and such\nthat 0 is the induced bigraphs with dual data produced by removing the first k  1\nvertices from  and declaring the unique vertex at depth k the new base vertex.\n5\n\n\f(The integer k is required to be even because duality is a different kind of structure\nfor odd depths and even depths.) We say a bigraph pair  is an extension of a equal\nbigraph pair 0 if  is the same as 0 up to the depth of 0 . We will use the phrase\n starts like 0  as an abbreviation for  is an extension of a translate of 0 .\nFor example, the D2n principal graph pairs are all translations of the D4 pair. The\nHaagerup principal graphs are an extension of D6 , an extension of A4 , a translated\nextension of D4 , and a translated extension of A2 .\nSince we are often looking not just at a particular bigraph pair, but instead at all\nways of extending and translating it, we do not insist that the Frobenius-Perron\neigenvalues of the two graphs in a bigraph pair are equal (although they are certainly\nequal for principal bigraph pairs of finite depth subfactors). Similarly, although most\ngraphs we discuss are finite depth, since we are considering all translated extensions\nof these graphs our results apply to infinite depth subfactors.\nWe also define a sequence of numbers associated to any bigraph.\nDefinition 2.5 The annular multiplicities {an }nN of a bigraph  are defined by\nthe formula\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn\nX\nn+r\nrn 2n\nwr\nan =\n(1)\nn+r nr\nr=0\n\nwhere wr is the number of length 2r loops on  based at the initial vertex.\nNote that the annular multiplicity an only depends on the bigraph  out to depth n.\nSince the annular multiplicities for the Al graphs are {1, 0, 0, 0, . . .}, the annular multiplicities an for any k -supertransitive graph are a1 = 0 and an = 1 for 1  n  k .\nThus we will often describe the annular multiplicities by dropping this initial string,\nand listing the sequence of annular multiplicities starting from the first non-trivial\nentry. If a bigraph pair is the principal bigraph pair of a subfactor, then the corresponding planar algebra is a representation of the annular Temperley-Lieb category,\nand these numbers are in fact the multiplicities of the irreducible representations (c.f.\n[Jon01, GL98, JR06]). More specifically, the irreducible unitary representations of\nthe annular Temperley-Lieb category at a parameter  are parametrized by the set\n{(0, ) |   [0, ] }  {(n, ) | n  N, n  1,   C,  n = 1 } ,\nand the annular multiplcity an is the sum of the multiplicities of all irreducible\nrepresentations of the form (n, x) for some x. In this paper, we only use the annular\nmultiplicities to divide up large collections of graphs, but other papers in this series\nwill make further use of the representation theory of the annular Temperley-Lieb\ncategory.\n\n2.2\n\nClassification statements\n\nMost of the results of this paper are of the following form:\nEvery subfactor whose principal bigraph pair is not A , which starts\nlike a fixed bigraph pair 0 , and which has index strictly between 4 and\n  R has principal bigraph pair which either\n6\n\n\f(1) is a translate (but not an extension!) of one of a certain set of\nbigraph pairs V , called vines, or\n(2) is a translate of an extension of one of a certain set of bigraph pairs\nW , called weeds.\nWe will abbreviate such a result by saying that the data (0 , , V, W) is a classification statement. The idea behind the names is that the vines can only grow\ntaller (i.e. increase supertransitivity) but the weeds can still grow out of control.\nThere are of course many boring classification statements, in particular we trivially\nhave (0 , , , {0 }) for any bigraph pair 0 . The interesting classification statements we produce will have weeds which are much larger than the bigraph pair 0 .\nIn ideal circumstances, we even find classification statements in which the set of\nweeds is empty.\nExample 1 In [Haa94], Haagerup proves the classification statement\n\n,\n), 3 + 3, VH , )\n((\nwith\nVH =\n\nn\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\u0011o\n\n,\n\nRemark. These families of graphs are called the Haagerup family, the AsaedaHaagerup family, and the hexagon family, respectively. In Haagerups paper he\nclaims that that in the Asaeda-Haagerup family only supertransitivity 5 is possible.\nSince Haagerups paper the hexagon family has been entirely ruled out [Bis98]\nand the Haagerup family at supertransitivities 11 and above have been ruled out\n[Asa07, AY09]. A uniform argument for all three cases (and indeed excluding all but\nfinitely many examples coming from any vine) can be given using [CMS10]. The\n3-supertransitive bigraph pair in the Haagerup family is realised as the principal\nbigraph pair of the Haagerup subfactor [AH99], and the 7-supertransitive bigraph\npair is realised by the extended Haagerup subfactor [BMPS09]. The Asaeda-Haagerup\nbigraph pair is also realised [AH99]. In this sense, the classification statement referred\nto above in terms of vines (and no weeds) has since been turned into a complete\nclassification. The goal of this paper is to prove a classification statement that can\nthen lead to a complete classification. Unlike in Haagerups case, we will still have\nseveral weeds in our classification.\n\n2.3\n\nThe odometer\n\nGiven a bigraph , we can readily enumerate all its extensions with depth one\ngreater and with Frobenius-Perron eigenvalue less than some limit . Indeed, the\nbound on the size of the Frobenius-Perron eigenvalue gives a bound on the valency of\neach vertex. In practice, one must be a little careful in order to do this enumeration\n7\n\n\fefficiently. Suppose weve already enumerated all extensions of  where the last\ndepth is has rank k , and we next want to find all extensions of  with k + 1 new\nvertices. In terms of the inclusion matrix between the final two depths we are looking\nfor ways of adding a new row to a fixed matrix such that the entries arent too large.\nThese can be enumerated via an odometer process: increment the first entry of the\nrow until the graph norm is too large, then reset the first entry and increment the\nsecond entry, and so on. In order to further increase efficiency we may assume that\nthe rows of the adjacency matrix between the top two depths are in lexicographic\norder, as permutations of the rows correspond to permutations of the new vertices,\ngiving isomorphic graphs.\nAgain with a fixed limit  on the Frobenius-Perron eigenvalue, we can enumerate all\ndepth one extensions of a bigraph with dual data  in much the same way. We first\nforget about dual data and extend the bigraph, then, if the new depth is even, for\neach extension we consider all possible involutions of the new vertices. We denote\nthe resulting set O ().\nGiven a bigraph pair which is equal, we can enumerate all depth one extensions\nso that both bigraphs have Frobenius-Perron dimension at most . When we are\nadding an odd depth, we are only interested in pairs where we add the same number\nof new vertices; in this case, because the duality involution between the new odd\nvertices is implicitly determined by the order in which they appear, we can insist\nthe rows of the new inclusion matrix are in lexicographic order when extending\none of the graphs, but not both. On the other hand, when we are adding an even\ndepth, there may be different numbers of new vertices on the two graphs, and we\ncan ask that both new inclusion matrices have rows in lexicographic order. This\nprocess frequently results in duplicate bigraph pairs which are related by a nontrivial\nbigraph isomorphism (which may permute vertices at earlier depths as well), and for\nefficiency these should be removed.\nReusing notation, we denote by O (W ) the set of all depth one extensions of a equal\nbigraph pair W . Alternatively, if W has odd depth we can extend one bigraph but\nnot the other, and we call the resulting set L (W ). When W has an even depth\nwe cant do this (because the numbers of new odd vertices on the new graphs must\nagree), so L (W ) = .\nThe following meta-theorem explains how to use these enumeration techniques,\nwhich we collectively call the odometer, to derive new classification statements from\nold ones.\nTheorem 2.6 (The odometer) Suppose we have a classification statement\n(0 , , V, {W }  W).\nThen there is another classification statement\n(0 , , V  {W }  L (W ), W  O (W )).\nProof This follows immediately from the definitions.\nNote that by repeatedly applying Theorem 2.6 we can arbitrarily increase the minimum depth of the weeds in a classification statement, at the expense of dramatically\n8\n\n\fincreasing the number of vines and weeds. When we say that we run the odometer\nwhat we mean is that we apply Theorem 2.6, remove all weeds and vines which do\nnot pass the associativity test (explained in the next section), and then repeat. See\nSection 4 for details.\nNext, we turn to another class of techniques for modifying classification statements:\nfinding obstructions that can rule out entire families of bigraph pairs, coming from\neither vines or weeds.\n\n3\n\nObstructions\n\nSuppose that  is a bigraph pair which starts like 0 . In this section we give several\nobstructions to  being the principal bigraph pair of a subfactor. Furthermore, all\nof these obstructions are local in the sense that they can be computed only from 0 .\nLocality in this sense is crucial because it means that these tests can be applied to\nremove vines and weeds from classification statements.\n\n3.1\n\nAssociativity\n\nRecall that the principal graph gives the multiplicities for tensoring on the right\nwith A BB and B BA between A  A bimodules and A  B bimodules. The dual\nprincipal graph gives the multiplicities for tensoring on the left with A BB and B BA\nbetween B  B bimodules and B  A bimodules. However, since taking duals\ninterchanges the order of tensor product, using the dual data we can also recover\nfrom a bigraph pair the multiplicities for fusion on the left by the basic bimodules.\n(The multiplicities for tensoring with the basic bimodules on both the left and right\nare often encoded, following Ocneanu, as a 4-partite graph. We find bigraph pairs\neasier to deal with combinatorially and far more compact to display. However, one\ncan easily go between the two descriptions.)\nBy associativity, we can first tensor on the left and then on the right, or we can first\ntensor on the right and then on the left. This gives a combinatorial obstruction for\npotential principal graph pairs. These associativity conditions were first observed\nby Ocneanu. In the language of paragroups, associativity becomes the condition\nthat biunitary matrices are square. In the language of bigraph pairs, associativity\nbecomes the following.\nLemma 3.1 Suppose that (, 0 ) is the principal bigraph pair of a subfactor and\nthat  and 0 are simply laced.\nConsider two vertices V and W of the same parity in the principal and dual principal\ngraphs respectively. The following two numbers are equal:\n(1) The number of vertices Z in the principal graph which are adjacent to V ,\nsuch that Z  is adjacent to W  .\n(2) The number of vertices U in the dual principal graph which are adjacent to\nW such that U  is adjacent to V  .\n9\n\n\fRemark. If the graphs are not simply laced, the same theorem holds if you count\nthe intermediate vertices with multiplicities corresponding to the product of the\nmultiplicities of the two adjacencies.\nThe obstruction given by the above theorem is local in the following sense. If V\nand W are not both the largest depth nor both at the smallest depth, then the\ndimensions computed in either of these fashions are the same for a bigraph pair 0\nas they are for any bigraph pair which starts like 0 . Furthermore, if V and W are\nboth at the largest depth, then the dimensions computed in either of these fashions\nare the same for all translates of the given graph.\nFor example, it is easy to see using the associativity test that if a graph begins like\nDn then its dual graph must also begin like Dn .\nWhile running the odometer, we can apply a trick which saves some time in checking\nthe associativity obstruction. Recall that when we are adding an even depth, we\nconstruct two sets L (W ) (in which we have extended only one of the two graphs)\nand O (W ) (in which both graphs have been extended). It is easy to see that the\nextended graph in any unequal extension in L (W ) which passes the (global, in\nthe sense of the paragraph of locality above) associativity test can not also pass\nthe (local) associativity test with any other extended graph in a level extension in\nO (W ). Suppose W = (W1 , W2 ), and W10 is an extension of W1 , W20 is an extension\nof W2 . Thus if either (W10 , W2 ) or (W1 , W20 ) satisfies the global associativity test,\nwe can immediately rule out the pair (W10 , W20 ) as an element of O (W ), because it\ncannot satisfies the local associativity test.\n\n3.2\n\nThe triple point obstruction\n\nVersions of the following results are proved in [Haa94], where they are attributed to\nOcneanu.\nLemma 3.2 Suppose (, 0 ) is the principal bigraph pair of a subfactor of index 4\nor larger, and V   and V   0 are a pair of dual triple points at an odd depth.\nDenote by K the three neighbours of V on , and by L the three neighbours of V \non 0 . Consider  : K  L, a dimension preserving bijection. Then there exists\nK  K and L  L so (K) 6= L, and an odd vertex Z 6= V on  so Z is adjacent\nto K and Z  is adjacent to L.\nLemma 3.3 Suppose (, 0 ) is the principal bigraph pair of a subfactor of index 4\nor larger, and V   and W  0 are a pair of triple points at an even depth, such\nthat the neighbours of V coincide with the duals of the neighbours of W  , and the\nduals of the neighbours of V  coincide with the neighbours of W . Denote by K the\nthree odd neighbours of V on , and by L the three odd neighbours of W on 0 .\nConsider  : K  L, a dimension preserving bijection. Then there exists K  K\nand L  L so (K) 6= L, and an even vertex Z 6= V on  so Z is adjacent to K\nand Z  is adjacent to L .\nBoth of these results are proved in the same way. Assume for the sake of contradiction\nthat the last condition (the existence of vertex adjacent to K and L) does not hold.\n10\n\n\fBy considering the paragroup (or equivalently the 6j-symbols) there is a 3-by-3\nunitary matrix each of whose matrix entries have specific absolute values. A short\nargument in linear algebra then shows that the index must be less than 4. See the\nproof of Proposition 3.5 from [Haa94] for more details.\nIn order for these lemmas to give us a local condition, we need to be able to determine\nwhich bijections are dimension preserving. However, under most circumstances it is\nnot possible to compute all the dimensions just from local information. However, if\nthe triple point in question is at depth n for an n-supertransitive subfactor, and if\nthe principal graphs are sufficiently simple through depth n + 2, then it is possible\nto apply the triple point obstruction without knowing anything about the graph at\nhigher depths.\nFirst let us fix some terminology. Suppose\nset, and that A1 , A2 , A01 ,\nS that S 0isSa finite\n0\n0\nand A2 are subsets of S with S = A1 A2 = A1 A2 . We call (S, A1 , A2 , A01 , A02 )\nforbidden if A1 and A2 are disjoint, A01 and A02 are disjoint and either A1 = A01\nand A2 = A02 , or A1 = A02 and A2 = A01 .\nCorollary 3.4 Suppose that a bigraph pair (, 0 ) has dual initial triple points at\nan even depth n. Let  and  be the vertices of  at depth n + 1. Let S be the\nset of vertices in the principal graph at depth n + 2. Let A1 be the set of vertices\nat depth n + 2 which are adjacent to  and let A2 be the set of vertices at depth\nn + 2 which are adjacent to  . Let A0i be the set of duals of vertices in Ai . If\n(S, A1 , A2 , A01 , A02 ) is forbidden, then (, 0 ) is not the principal bigraph pair of a\nsubfactor of index 4 or more.\nCorollary 3.5 Suppose that a bigraph pair (, 0 ) has dual initial triple points at\nan odd depth n. Let  and  be the two vertices of  at depth n + 1 and 0 ,  0\nthe two vertices of 0 at depth n + 1. Let S be the set of vertices of  at depth\nn + 2. Let A1 be the set of vertices at depth n + 2 which are adjacent to  and let\nA2 be the set of vertices at depth n + 2 which are adjacent to  . Let A01 and A02 be\nthe duals of the vertices at depth n + 2 which are adjacent to 0 and  0 respectively.\nIf (S, A1 , A2 , A01 , A02 ) is forbidden, then (, 0 ) is not the principal bigraph pair of a\nsubfactor of index 4 or more.\nProof Both of these results follow quickly from the above by using the fact that if\ntwo vertices have the same set of adjacent vertices, then they must have the same\ndimension.\n\n3.3\n\nDuals at depth n + 1\n\nSuppose that  is an n-supertransitive bigraph with duals for n odd. Suppose that\na of the vertices at depth n + 1 are self-dual and that 2b of them are not self-dual.\nConsidering the 180-degree rotation acting on the quotient of n + 1-box space by\nthe ideal of elements which factor through the n  1-box space, we see that the\ndimension of the 1-eigenspace is b and the dimension of the +1-eigenspace is a + b.\nLemma 3.6 Suppose that (, 0 ) is the principal bigraph pair of a subfactor, and\nthat a, b, a0 , b0 are defined as above. Then a = a0 and b = b0 .\n11\n\n\fProof Because the half-click rotation gives isomorphisms between the corresponding\neigenspaces of the shaded and unshaded n + 1 box space, we must have b = b0 and\na + b = a0 + b0 , and hence (a, b) = (a0 , b0 ).\n\n3.4\n\nEven quadruple points\n\nThe following obstruction to quadruple points is proved by Jones using quadratic\ntangles techniques. A more sophisticated version of this argument will rule out Q\nentirely.\nTheorem 3.7 The principal graph pair of a subfactor does not begin like\n\u0010\n\u0011\n.\n,\n\nProof [Jon03, Theorem 5.2.2.]\n\n4\n\nRunning the odometer\n\nBy running the odometer on a classification statement we mean repeating the\nfollowing two procedures:\n(1) Apply Theorem 2.6 to the classification statement, extending all the weeds by\none depth.\n(2) Apply the associativity test and remove all vines and all weeds which fail it.\nWe have written a package of computer programs which automates the odometer,\nand we describe its use at the end of this section. It is easy (but very tedious) to\ncheck the output of this program by hand. Weve included figures which summarize\nthe output of the odometer as it runs. These figures are trees, with the initial graph\non the left, and each successive equal shows the new weeds that arise that pass the\nassociativity tests. See below for more details.\nThe example that we consider\n reproduces a small part of Haagerups classification of\nsubfactors out to index 3 + 3 by finding a complete set of vines for principal graph\npairs starting like\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(, 0 ) =\n,\nwith index less that 3 +\n\n\n\n3.\n\nWe now runthe odometer\u0001 beginning with the tautological classification statement\n(, 0 ), 3 + 3, , {(, 0 )} .\n12\n\n\fWe \nfirst enumerate all the depth 1 extensions of  and 0 with norms less than\n3 + 3. Using the notation of 2.3, we have\nn\n,\n,\nO3+3 () =\n\nO3+3 (0 ) =\n\n\b\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\no\n\n,\n\n,\n\no\n\nNow, for the depth one extensions of the bigraph pair (, 0 ), we take one graph\nfrom each list, subject to the condition that the two graphs have the same number\nof vertices at the new (odd) depth. Since the depth were adding is an odd depth,\nthere is no need to choose an involution of the new vertices specifying dual data.\nOn the other hand, it is important that in at least one of the lists O3+3 () and\nO3+3 (0 ) we include as distinct elements graphs which differ by a permutation of\nthe vertices at the new depth, since the duality for odd vertices is given by their\nvertical ordering. In the lists above, it is convenient to remove such redundancies in\nthe first list, but not in the second, as there are no redundancies there anyway.\nNext, we apply the associativity test of Lemma 3.1, remembering to only use the local\nversion where at least one of the vertices V and W are not at the newly introduced\ndepth and at least one is not the root vertex. This cuts down the previous large list\nto just two bigraph pairs,\nn\u0010\n\u0011\n,\nW1 =\n,\n\u0010\n\u0011o\n,\n.\nAs an example of how we rule out all the others, the bigraph pair\n!\n\nV\n\n,\n\nW\n\nfails the associativity test with the marked vertices: there is one vertex satisfying\nthe conditions for Z in Lemma 3.1, but none satisfying the conditions for U .\nHaving found all equal extensions, we now look for unequal extensions of (, 0 ) to\nadd to the list of vines and apply the associativity test for vines (where we allow V\nand W to both be at the largest depth). Since the new depth were adding is odd,\nthere can be no unequal extensions. (However, notice that unequal extensions are\neasy to enumerate, theyre of the form (, G 0 ) for G 0  O3+3 (0 ) or of the form\n(G, 0 ) for G  O3+3 ()).\n13\n\n\fFinally, the old weed (, 0 ) is added to the list of vines. So we can apply the\nassociativity test to this as a vine and see that it fails.\nAt this point weve successfully run\none step. We now have the\n the odometer\n\u0001\n0\nclassification statement (,  ), 3 + 3, , W1 . The progress of the odometer so far\nis summarized by the following figure.\n\nThe current weeds are highlighted in the figure in red. The old weed (, 0 ) is left in\nthe picture to explain what happened in the odometer at earlier steps (in this case\nthe zeroth step) and is necessary for recovering the vines (see below).\nWe now run the odometer another step. This means we go through the above process\nfor each of the two weeds. One of the weeds has no extensions which pass the\nassociativity test. The other weed has two extensions. Furthermore there are two\nvines which pass, one of which is unequal.\nAt this point we have proved the classification statement\n\u0010\n\n(, 0 ), 3 + 3,\nn\u0010\n,\n\u0010\n,\nn\u0010\n,\n\u0010\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\u0011o\n\nand the progress of the odometer is summarized by the following figure.\n\n14\n\n\u0011\n\u0011 o\u0011\n\n\fRunning the odometer the next step gets us down to a single weed, summarized by\nthe figure\n\nOn the next step of the odometer, there are no weeds that pass the\nAt this point the odometer stops, with nothing more to do. So our\nclassification statement\n\u0010\n\n(, 0 ), 3 + 3,\nn\u0010\n,\n\u0010\n,\n\u0010\n,\n\u0010\n,\n\u0011\n\n\nassociativity test.\nfinal result is the\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\u0011\n\u0011o\n,\n\nwhose proof is summarized by the following figure.\n\nTo read a classification statement off from a figure do the following:\n The weeds are the graph pairs highlighted in red.\n The equal vines are the graph pairs not highlighted which in addition pass the\nassociativity test for pairs of vertices at the largest depth (associativity for\nother pairs of vertices has already been checked).\n The unequal vines are found by looking at unequal extensions of the nonhighlighted pairs and checking associativity. Note that if a graph pair passes\nthe full associativity test, then any unequal extension of it automatically fails\nthe associativity test. Furthermore, it is often easy to quickly deduce by\nhand the unequal extensions which pass the associativity test rather than\nenumerating then testing all of them.\nFinally, we include a brief tutorial on using the Mathematica package called FusionAtlas\n(written by the authors along with Dave Penneys, Emily Peters and James Tener) to\nperform these calculations. First, youll need a copy of the package. The best way\nto obtain this is to first install Subversion, then type at the command line\n15\n\n\fsvn checkout http://tqft.net/svn/FusionAtlas/\nThis will create a FusionAtlas directory in your current directory. Now, in\nMathematica, we need to load the package. First, we add it to the path, with\na command like\nIn[1]:=\n\nAppendTo[$Path, \" /FusionAtlas/\"]\n\n(if you downloaded the package somewhere outside your home directory, youll need\nto adjust this path). Next, we load the package, with\nIn[2]:=\n\n<<FusionAtlas\n\n(note the backtick at the end of the line). You should see a message saying the\npackage has been successfully loaded.\nThe most powerful command for running the odometer is\nFindBigraphPairExtensionsUpToDepth[L][g1,g2,k]\nHere L is the graph norm limit were working with (the square root of the index),\nwhich should be some\n real number strictly larger than the limit were really interested\nin. Weve used 5 + 103 throughout. Using a slightly higher limit means that\nsometimes spurious results will be returned with index above 5, that have to be\nremoved. The parameters g1 and g2 are the bigraphs with dual data that we want\nto extend. You can find a description of the syntax for specifying bigraphs on the\nFusionAtlas web page, at http://tqft.net/wiki/Atlas_of_subfactors. All\nbigraphs have a representation as a string (you can find many examples by looking\nat the LATEX source of the article, from the arXiv: all the diagrams are generated\nautomatically from these strings), and you can generate the appropriate expressions\nin Mathematica from these strings using the function GraphFromString, and display\nbigraphs using DisplayBigraph, for example\nIn[3]:=\n\ng1 = GraphFromString[\"bwd1v1v1v1p1v1x0p0x1v1x0p0x1p0x1duals1v1v1x2v2x1x3\"]\n\nOut[3]= BigraphWithDuals[ GradedBigraph[{{1}}, {{1}}, {{1}}, {{1}, {1}},\n{{1, 0}, {0, 1}}, {{1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, 1}}], DualData[{1}, {1}, {1, 2},\n{2, 1, 3}]]\n\ng2 = GraphFromString[\"bwd1v1v1v1p1v0x1p0x1v0x1duals1v1v1x2v1\"]\nOut[4]= BigraphWithDuals[ GradedBigraph[{{1}}, {{1}}, {{1}}, {{1}, {1}},\n{{0, 1}, {0, 1}}, {{0, 1}}], DualData[{1}, {1}, {1, 2}, {1}]]\nIn[4]:=\n\nIn[5]:=\n\nDisplayBigraph[g2]\n\nOut[5]=\n\nThe final parameter k specifies the maximum number of times to run the odometer;\n is an allowed value, although in that case there is no guarantee of termination.\nThe output of FindBigraphPairExtensionsUpToDepth is a list of three lists. The\nfirst list consists of all the vines produced, the second list consists of all the weeds\nproduced, and in this mode the third list is always empty. Thus we can run\n16\n\n\fIn[6]:=\n\n{vines, weeds, {}} =\nFindBigraphPairExtensionsUpToDepth[Sqrt[3+Sqrt[3]]+103 ][g1,g2,];\n\nIn[7]:=\n\nDisplayBigraph /@ vines\n\nOut[7]=\n\nn\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0011o\n\nweeds\nOut[8]= {}\nIn[8]:=\n\nexactly reproducing the classification described above.\nFinally, it is possible to tell FindBigraphPairExtensionsUpToDepth to not run the\nodometer further on some specific weeds, by supplying a fourth argument \"Weeds\"\n-> { {h1, h2}, {h3, h4}, ... }, where {h1, h2} are a bigraph pair, etc. Now\nthe third list in the output repeats back these weeds which were not run further.\nSince this paper was finished, we have written an independent and much faster\nreimplementation of the odometer in the language Scala. Happily, it produces all\nthe same results as those described here (and does so in under a minute on a MacBook\nPro). This reimplementation is not yet in a state that others can readily use, but we\nare happy to share the code and expect that it will soon be more accessible.\n\n5\n\n1-supertransitive subfactors\n\nIn this section we use ad hoc methods to eliminate all 1-supertransitive subfactors\nof index between 4 and 5. This reduces the size of the odometer output drastically,\nsimply because there are far fewer 3-supertransitive graphs below index 5 than\nthere are 1-supertransitive graphs below index 5. The crux of the proof is that no\nsubfactor of index between 4 and 5 can have an intermediate subfactor.\nTheorem 5.1 There are no 1-supertransitive subfactors with index strictly between\n4 and 5.\nProof Suppose that all of the objects at depth 2 have dimension 1. Then the\nindex is an integer, and so does not lie between 4 and 5. Suppose that some object\nat depth 2 has dimension 1, but that not all objects at depth 2 have dimension 1.\nThen there must exist an intermediate subfactor. However, there are no numbers\nbetween 4 and 5 which are the product of two allowed indices.\n17\n\n\fLet X be the fundamental object. Suppose that there is an object V at depth 2\nwith dimension bigger than 1 but less than 2. Consider the connected component of\nX in the fusion graph for tensoring on the left with V . (Be careful here: usually\nwe talk about principal graphs for tensoring on the right with an object.) The\nFrobenius-Perron eigenvalue for this graph is dim V < 2, hence this graph must\nbe an ADET type graph. Furthermore, the Frobenius-Perron eigenvector is, up to\nscaling, given by the dimensions of the fundamental object and the other objects\nwhich come up in the fusion graph. From the principal graph we see that theres\na non-zero map from X  X   V . Hence by Frobenius reciprocity, theres a\nnonzero map X  V  X . Therefore in the fusion graph, X must have a self-loop.\nHence X must be at the loop end of a type T graph. Let Y0 , Y1 , . . . be the other\nobjects in this graph with Y0 all the way at the non-loop end. Then the normalized\nFrobenius-Perron eigenvector is (1, dim Y1 / dimY0 , . . . , dim X/ dim Y0 ). If the fusion\ngraph is T2 we see that dim X/ dim Y0 = (1 + 5)/2.\n If dim Y0 = 1, then the index,\n2\n(dim X) , is less than 4, while if dim Y0 is at least 2 then dim X is larger than 5.\nIf the fusion graph is Tk for k > 2, then (dim X)2 > (dim X/ dim Y0 )2 > 5.\nThus there are at least two objects at depth 2 both of which have dimension at least\n2, hence the index is at least 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\nWe note that in order to extend our work here to include index equal to 5, one\nwould have to classify by hand the 1-supertransitive graphs at index exactly 5, by\nextending the methods of the proof here.\n\n6\n\nMain result\n\nWe now use the techniques described in the three previous sections to develop\nclassification statements for all subfactors with index between 4 and 5. In particular,\nwe obtain the following classification statement with a manageable set of weeds.\nTheorem 6.1 Subfactors with index between 4 and 5 are described by the classification statement\n((\n,\n), 5, V , W )\nwith\nV =\n\nn\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n18\n\n\f\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n19\n\n\f\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\n,\n\u0011o\n\nand\nn\n\u0010\nW = C =\n\u0010\nF=\n\u0010\nB=\n\u0010\nQ=\n\u0010\nQ0 =\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0011o\n\nThe vines can all be eliminated (with four exceptions: Haagerup, Asaeda-Haagerup,\nextended Haagerup, and 2221) by showing that the indices are non-cyclotomic by\napplying the results of [CMS10]. This will be done in an upcoming paper [PT10] by\nDave Penneys and James Tener. Furthermore, a forthcoming joint paper[MPPS10]\nwith Dave Penneys and Emily Peters shows that there are no subfactors with principal\ngraphs starting like B , C or F , at any index. A forthcoming paper [IJMS] joint with\nMasaki Izumi and Vaughan Jones shows that there are no subfactors with principal\ngraphs starting like Q or Q0 at any index other than the 3331 principal graph.\nThe rest of this section is dedicated to the proof of Theorem 6.1. First, in 6.1 we\nproduce an initial list of weeds, which begin with either a triple point or a quadruple\npoint. In 6.2, we then run the odometer for a single step extending all of the triple\npoint weeds by one depth. We then apply the triple point obstruction from 3.2 to\nrule out many of the resulting weeds. We then run the odometer on all the surviving\ntriple points weeds. In most cases we can iterate this until no more weeds survive,\nbut for one weed with annular multiplicities 10 (the one responsible for the Haagerup,\nextended Haagerup, and Asaeda-Haagerup subfactors) we have to stop the odometer\nby hand, leaving a set of three more complicated weeds. In 6.3 we run the odometer\non all the quadruple point weeds, stopping again with a more complicated set of\nweeds. In 6.3.2 we rule out certain of these weeds by hand. The full list of vines and\nweeds in Theorem 6.1 above is assembled out of all the vines and weeds produced in\nthe various subsections.\n20\n\n,\n\n\f6.1\n\nInitial seeds\n\nLemma 6.2 We have the classification statement\n((\n\n,\n\n), 5, , W1 )\n\nwith\nn\n\u0010\nW1 = o1,a =\n\u0010\no1,b =\n\u0010\no1,c =\n\u0010\ne1 =\n\u0010\no2,a =\n\u0010\no2,b =\n\u0010\no2,c =\n\u0010\ne2 =\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\n,\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0011o\n\nProof By Theorem 5.1, we can assume that any odd-supertransitive bigraphs with\nindex less than 5 are at least 3-supertransitive. Since the 5-pointed star and the\nvertex with a single and double edge coming into it both have norm 5, it follows\nthat there are only two possibilities at the first non-trivial depth: we have either a\nvertex of valence 3 or a vertex of valence 4. By the associativity test both graphs\nmust have the same valency.\nThe naming scheme xn,m indicates whether the branch point is at an odd or even\ndepth, according to whether x = o or x = e, the number n denotes the annular\nmultiplicity at the depth one past the branch point, and then m is an arbitrary\nalphabetic index.\nWe immediately rule out the weeds o1,b and o2,b on the basis of Lemma 3.6.\nThe proof of Theorem 6.1 will follow by successively applying the odometer and\nremoving graphs which fail the obstructions.

The standard\nexample is the second last pair from Equation (6.1), which was treated by Haagerup.\nIn our notation, A1 = A01 and A2 = A02 , so the pair is forbidden.\nAt this point, it is convenient to partition the remaining weeds which begin with a\ntriple point according to their annular multiplicities.

It appears that running the odometer\nnever terminates  weeds with arbitrarily high depth appear. Thus, we choose a\n25\n\n\fcertain set of weeds to terminate at, balancing the desire for a small list of weeds\nwhich are as deep as possible with the desire for a small list of vines. The particular\nchoices weve made were influenced by our expectation of various methods eliminating\nvines or weeds in subsequent papers, in particular the quadratic tangles methods\nwhich we will use to eliminate certain weeds with annular multiplicities 10.\nTheorem 6.5 There is a classification statement\n\u0010\u0010\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n, 5, V10 , W10\n\n\u0011\n\nwhere\nV10 =\n\nn\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n,\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\u0011o\n\nand\nW10 =\n\nn\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\n,\n26\n\n,\n\u0011\n\n,\n\u0011o\n\n\fProof See Figure 4.\n\n6.3\n\nQuadruple points\n\nIn the next subsection we run the odometer on all of the quadruple point weeds.\nIn each case, the odometer runs forever, so we carefully choose a convenient set of\nstopping points, thus exchanging the current list of weeds for another slightly longer\nlist of more complicated weeds, along with several vines.

Now q must lie between 1.59 and\n[4]\n[3]\n\n< 2 cos( 6 ) < 2, which is not an allowed dimension.\n\nNext, we find that we can just run the odometer on\n\u0010\n5321 =\n,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\nand obtain the classification statement\n(5321 , 5, V5321 , )\nwhere V5321 is the list of graph pairs appearing in the statement of the theorem.\nThe output of the odometer appears in Figure 8.\nTheorem\n6.10 Any subfactor with index below\n\u0010\n\u0011 5 with principal graph pair starting\nlike\n,\nmust be a translate of one of the\nfollowing graph pairs:\nn\u0010\n\u0011\n,\n,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n,\n,\n\u0010\n\u0011o\n,\nProof First, observe that without any translation, the univalent vertex at depth 3\nhas dimension [3]\n[2] . We know that for any extension of , q must lie between 1.56\n\n\nand 1+2 5 . In this range, 1 < 2 cos( 6 ) <\ndimension.\n\n[3]\n[2]\n\n< 2 cos( 7 ) < 2, which is not an allowed\n\nNext,\nwe increase the supertransitivity by two and run\n\u0010\n\u0011 the odometer on 4321 =\n,\n, but only for a few additional depths, obtaining the classification statement\n(4321 , 5, V4321 , {4621 })\nwith V4321 the list of graph pairs appearing in the statement of the theorem and\n\u0010\n\u0011\n4621 =\n,\nThe output of the odometer appears in Figure 9.\nFor the new weed weve produced, 4621 , we again split into cases.\nWithout any translation, we look at the vertex at depth 10 and see that it has\ndimension\np(q) = q 10  q 8  2q 6  3q 4  4q 2  6  4q 2  3q 4  2q 6  q 8 + q 10 .\n29\n\n\fThe largest real root of p is at \napproximately 1.61501, so for any q in the relevant\n1+ 5\nrange, namely 1.6161 < q < 2 , p is strictly increasing. Moreover, p( 1+2 5 ) = 1,\nso in fact the dimension of this vertex is always strictly less than 1, which is not\nallowed.\nTranslating 4621 by two, we find that the index of the graph is approximately\n5.0062 > 5.\nTheorem 6.11 No subfactor with index below 5 has principal graph which starts\nlike\n.\nProof If you translate this graph by 1 then its graph norm is 5 (and in fact the\ngraph is the principal graph for the group-subgroup factor A4  A5 ), so we need\nonly consider extensions (rather than translates of extensions).\n\n\nWe need only consider q between 1.59438 and 1+2 5 . In this range, at least one of\nthe two vertices at depth 5 will have dimension less than 1, which is a contradiction.\nTo see this, notice that the sum of the dimensions of the two vertices at depth 5 is\n1  3q 4  5q 6  3q 8 + q 12\n.\nq5 + q7\nThis is equal to 2 near q = 0.61492 and q = 1.62623 and smaller than 2 between\nthose two values. In particular, it is smaller than 2 in the range that we are\nconsidering.\n\n7\n\nFuture directions\n\nAs we explained in the introduction, this paper is the first step towards classifying\nsubfactors of index less than 5. We complete this classification in a series of subsequent papers. This project was developed at several Planar Algebra Programming\nCamps organized by the authors and Emily Peters, and hosted by Vaughan Jones.\nFurther progress was made during a visit by the current authors with Masaki Izumi\nat Kyoto University. As a result the subsequent papers in the project have a variety\nof different authors.\nAll translates of the vines in our classification can all be eliminated (with four\nexceptions, corresponding to subfactors that actually exist: Haagerup, AsaedaHaagerup, extended Haagerup, and 2221) by showing that the indices are noncyclotomic by applying the results of [CMS10]. This will be done in a forthcoming\npaper [PT10] by David Penneys and James Tener.\nTheres not yet a uniform approach to eliminating the weeds, which we instead deal\nwith separately. In a joint paper with David Penneys and Emily Peters, we will\nprove that there are no subfactors (of any index) whose principal graphs begin like\nB , C , or F . This paper uses several different triple point obstructions coming\nfrom the theory of connections and from an identity proved by Vaughan Jones in\n[Jon03]. The quadratic tangles identity does not eliminate the weed B as there the\n30\n\n\frotational eigenvalue is 1 and the identity is automatically satisfied. However, we\nare able to apply an ad hoc connections argument to remove that case.\nIn a forthcoming paper with Masaki Izumi and Vaughan Jones we will show that\nthe only subfactor with principal graphs starting like either Q or Q0 is the 3311\nsubfactor, which is unique up to taking duals. The quadratic tangles technique from\n[Jon03] can also be applied to graphs which begin with a quadruple point, and this\napproach readily rules out subfactors with principal graphs beginning like Q. A\nconnections argument due to Izumi, followed by a number theoretic argument along\nthe lines of [CMS10] shows that any principal graph starting like Q0 must in fact be\nthe 3331 graph. An involved argument then establishes that any subfactor with this\nprincipal graph must be (up to taking dual) the GHJ subfactor.\nThe final piece of the classification is the uniqueness of the 2221 subfactor. This\nhas recently been established in the Ph.D. thesis of Richard Han [Han10], who was\nable to derive a set of generators and relations for the corresponding planar algebra\ndirecting from the principal graphs.\nA natural related question is to consider subfactors of index exactly 5. Our techniques generalize easily to understanding possible principal graphs at index equal\nto 5, however, the uniqueness problem becomes more difficult. The techniques\nfor constructing subfactors of integer index are somewhat different from those of\nnon-integer index (in particular, Hopf algebraic techniques, and group cohomology)\nso we have avoided dealing with the index 5 case in detail. However, as was pointed\nout to us by Izumi, using the results from [Izu97] simplifies the situation immensely.\nWe now expect to be able to extend our classification to index equal to 5.\n\nReferences\n[AH99] Marta Asaeda\nExotic subfactors of finite depth with Jones\n and Uffe Haagerup.\n\nindices (5 + 13)/2 and (5 + 17)/2.
